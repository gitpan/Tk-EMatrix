EMatrix.pm

This module requires that Tk::TableMatrix be installed!

A widget derived from Tk::TableMatrix that includes 6 additional methods.

I created this widget mainly to make it more user friendly for use as
a way to display records (say as part of a SQL interface), rather than 
a spreadsheet substitute.

The methods are bindRow(), bindCol(), getRow(), getRowHash(), getCol()
and getColHash().

In the future, I'm going to consider adding some methods that help it
to directly interface with MS Excel documents.  I may also try to add
an Excel look & feel.
